/*
  This function takes in two parameters: a number, and a string.
  The number represents the amount of hours/minutes/seconds.
  The string represents the unit, and is one of
    * "hour"
    * "minute"
    * "second"

  It returns a whole number value from 0-255 representing the
  relative CSS RGB value of that time period.

  It's pre-written for you. Best to not muck around with it.
